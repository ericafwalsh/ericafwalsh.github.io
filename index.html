    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hello everyone! Welcome to my first website. I'd love to tell you a little about myself, and my current "side hustle" - learning to code!</p>

    <img src="assets\images\5C0A9698_pp.JPG" alt="Erica W" width="130" height="190">

    <p>I have a rather extensive education in biology, and bats specifically (more on that later). Coming out of that experience, I had my first hard pivot in my professional career
      - joining a fast moving ecommerce startup. Here I was immersed in the tech industry and had a front row seat to tech innovation within retail. Working as a buyer in the consumable space, 
      I have pretty much become an expert in soap. Welcome to my next pivot - coding class! I am now dedicating my Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and let's be honest, every other free moment, 
      to learning full stack web development.  
    </p>

    <p>Low and behold, my first official (live) website in my early web development career. I hope you enjoy it, and I welcome any feedback you have. Thank you!</p>
