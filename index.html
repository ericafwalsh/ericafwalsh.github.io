      <p>Hello everyone! Welcome to my first website. I'd love to tell you a little about myself, and my current "side
        hustle" - learning to code!</p>

      <p>I have an education in biology, and early in my professional career I pivoted to join 
        a fast moving e-commerce startup. Here I was immersed in the tech industry and had a front row seat to
        tech innovation within retail. Working as a buyer in the consumable space,
        I have pretty much become an expert in soap. Welcome to my next pivot - coding class! I am now dedicating my
        Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and let's be honest, every other free moment,
        to learning full stack web development.
      </p>

      <p>Low and behold, my first official (live) website in my early web development career. I hope you enjoy it, and I
        welcome any feedback you have. Thank you!</p>
